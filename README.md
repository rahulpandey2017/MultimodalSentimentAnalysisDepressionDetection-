# MultimodalSentimentAnalysisDepressionDetection-
This is for our Innovation Lab, we want to implement a system which through analysis of social media can detect depression in people.

week 1:
For this week, we have started Andrew Ng's course on machine learning:
We have so, far covered the topics:

Regression Techniques
Linear Regression
Multiple Features Regression
Logistic Regression

A central feature common among all these methods is that to attain a minimum point of a function, we try to look for a point that is in essence less in value compared to all its neightbouring points and for this what we do is that we apply an algorithm known as gradient descent.
This is nothing but going in the direction of steepest descent, taking small steps, in a sense this is a use of the calculus of finite differences.
usually, linear functions of the form:
ax+by+cz etc.
